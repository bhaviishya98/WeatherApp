# WeatherApp
Weather App is a weather forecasting app which forecasts the weather of any location using the OpenWeatherMap api. The website fetches weather data from the api and uses it to tell us the temp, pressure, humidity, wind speed and description about the weather of any location. In the background, random images are generated using unsplash.
